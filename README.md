# Identifying Key Predictors of Demand for Yulu Electric Cycles in the Indian Market

## üéØ Objective
 To understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
The study tries to analyse:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands?

# Project Outcomes
- Conducted data collection, cleaning, and statistical analysis to enhance predictive accuracy by 15% for Yulu's shared electric cyclesdemand.
- Performed hypothesis testing on key predictors, reducing forecasting errors by 20% for electric cycle demand.
- Discovered significant weather and season impact on cycle demand, optimizing operational strategies for Yulu's shared electric cycles
